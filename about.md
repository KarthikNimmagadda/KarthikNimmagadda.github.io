I am a software engineer who likes to run :) . I live in Overland Park, Kansas. In this blog, I will share technical tips, tricks, and solutions for the common issues I faced. Most of the content here will be Javascript, Java, and Ruby. Here and there I will sprinkle few posts about life and philosophy. This blog is my attempt to learn and retain concepts as much as sharing it with others.
