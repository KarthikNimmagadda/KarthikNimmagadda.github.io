I am a software engineer working at Cerner Corporation. I live in Overland Park, Kansas. This website is primarily focused on sharing technical tips, tricks, and solutions for the issues that I have faced. Most of the information I share would be regarding Javascript, Java, Ruby and sometimes life in general. I believe to retain concepts/ ideas its always good to share. This is my attempt to learn and retain concepts as much as sharing it with others.

### More Information

* I like to do long distance runs. This year(2017) I ran Kansas city marathon.
* Cycling is my new hobby.
* Basketball is my favorite sport.
* I read books, my favorite book of all time is Jonathan Livingston Seagull.
