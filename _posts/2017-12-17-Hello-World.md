In this blog, I will share technical tips, tricks, and solutions for the common issues I faced. Most of the content here will be Javascript, Java, and Ruby. Here and there I will sprinkle few posts about life and philosophy. This blog is my attempt to learn and retain concepts as much as sharing it with others.

For my first post I want to leave you with this Kobe Bryant's video about transformation, Please click on the image to play the video.
