This website is primarily focused on sharing technical tips, tricks and solutions for the issues that I have faced. Most of the information I share would be regarding Javascript, Java, Ruby and sometimes life in general. I believe to learn and retain concepts and ideas its always good to share. This is my attempt to learn and retain concepts as much as sharing it to others.

For my first post I want to leave you with this Kobe Bryant video about transformation:
